# Deep Q Learning Replication

*In collaboration with [Warren Sunada-Wong](https://github.com/The20thDuck).*

This repository replicates Deep Q Learning as described in Mnih et al.'s ["Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236) on the [Acrobot environment](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/acro.bot/) from OpenAI's [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/).
